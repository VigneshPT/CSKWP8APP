Founded in 2008, the team is currently captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming, a former New Zealand cricketer. The team's home ground is the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (often referred to as Chepauk) located in Chennai. The team has won the IPL title twice in succession (2010 and 2011) and reached the play-offs every season.

The leading run-scorer of the side is Suresh Raina, while the leading wicket-taker is Albie Morkel. The brand value of Chennai Super Kings in 2012 was estimated at US$75.13 million, making them the most valuable franchise in the IPL." FontFamily="Segoe WP" FontWeight="Light" TextWrapping="Wrap" />
